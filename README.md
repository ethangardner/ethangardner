## Hi, I'm Ethan 👋!

Thanks for looking at my profile. If you're here, you might be wondering about my contributions.

I have been a software engineer for over 20 years. In that time, I have held leadership positions on the management and technical tracks. I have worked in a variety of industries like SaaS, hospitality, B2B, and the public sector, but most of my work experience has been in the media and publishing industry.

I'm currently navingating all of the exciting developments in the AI space and working in the public sector. I'm currently contributing to the [web components flavor of the US Web Design System](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-elements/). Here are some career highlights and interesting facts ⚡:

- I'm a full-stack engineer with a focus on the front-end, but I've written everything from backend services, design systems, CI/CD pipelines, and desktop and mobile apps.

- I have written articles and spoken internationally on web performance, most recently at [Performance Now](https://perfnow.nl/) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
